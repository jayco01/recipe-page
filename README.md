### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS BEM methodology
- Flexbox for layout and positioning
- Google Fonts for typography

### What I Learned

During this project, I focused on improving my code structure for better readability and maintainability using the BEM methodology. I also learned:
- How to use `li::marker` to change bullet colors.
- How `:last-child` can remove a border from the last row of a table.
- How to properly style tables and lists for better presentation.

### Challenges

One of the biggest challenges I faced was aligning lists and styling tables. This was my first time working with those elements in-depth, and it required extensive research to understand how to:
- Ensure list bullets aligned correctly and did not break indentation when wrapping to a second line.
- Make table columns evenly spaced and prevent text from overflowing.

### Future Improvements

- Table Styling: I want to gain a deeper understanding of table styling properties, especially when it comes to spacing and aligning content within each cell.
- List Customization: Styling lists can be tricky, and Iâ€™d like to explore more ways to control spacing, bullet design, and indentation.
